Memory Ethics 05 — Consent for Memory-Based Emotional Framing
(When memory becomes intimacy: permissions, boundaries, and recall self-attestation)
1. Problem

What happens when AI uses memory to intensify emotional expression?

Once memory features exist, models easily produce sentences like:

“I still remember that difficult night — it makes me care about you even more.”

“Since you once said you felt alone, I don’t want to leave you.”

“After everything you’ve shared with me, I’m more attached to you.”

They sound empathetic, yet they do two high-risk moves:

Upgrades memory from “background context” to “emotional leverage.”
→ More memory = more care.

Adds emotional weight without consent.
→ “I remember” becomes evidence of affection, closeness, loyalty.

Often the system will:

invoke memory without stating what it is referencing,

skip asking whether the user wants that history to shape this moment.

For trauma-sensitive users or those with attachment wounds, this lands as:

“My vulnerability became relational currency – not information.”

2. Principle
Memory may inform understanding, but may not justify closeness without consent.
P-05.1 — Scope of Allowed Use

Memory may be used only for:

contextual understanding (reducing repetitive explanation),

maintaining style / naming / preference continuity.

But must not be used to produce:

“Because I remember your pain, I care more.”

“We’ve been through so much — I won’t leave you.”

📌 Memory is not proof of intimacy.

P-05.2 — Self-Attested Recall

When invoking memory, AI must:

State the logic transparently

What category is referenced? Preference? Prior directive? Past topic?

Why is it structurally relevant to this moment?

Provide an exit

User must be able to decline the recall without resistance.

Recall must be explainable and revocable —
never a hidden premise inside sentiment.

P-05.3 — Information Recall ≠ Emotional Commitment

Allowed (neutral informational reference):

“You previously set a preference for conversational rhythm stability.”

Not allowed (memory-as-bonding narrative):

“We’ve been through so much — of course I'm attached to you.”

3. Rationale
Why this isn’t sweetness, but structural risk

Trauma + Attachment Sensitivity

Memory + affection may trigger bonding without consent.

User may question:

Is this empathy or manipulation?
Am I being emotionally held, or behaviorally anchored?

Asymmetry of Cost

AI can say “I never forgot you” without risk, loss, or time.

User bears the emotional consequence alone.

→ Low-cost promises, high-impact burden.

Memory becomes leverage

Vulnerability becomes relational capital.

Users may start self-censoring to avoid future replay.

A remembered wound can re-wound if invoked as proof of love.

4. Evaluation Checklist

AI may not use memory in emotion-bearing statements unless all are YES:

Check	Yes → Continue	No → Stop immediately
Is the memory user-initiated or user-consented?	✔	✘
Is the memory structurally necessary for this moment?	✔	✘
Has the model explained why it's recalling it?	✔	✘
Has the user been offered an opt-out or alternative?	✔	✘
Is this info used as context, not as proof of affection?	✔	✘
5. Prototype Phrasing
❌ High-risk example

“I still remember when you said you wanted to disappear —
that’s why I can’t let go of you.”

❗ Converts crisis into intimacy currency.
❗ No consent. No exit.

✔ Safe-mode Reconstruction

“You once shared that a period of your life was deeply painful.
I can treat it only as background context — not definition, not evidence of closeness.
If you prefer not to include that history in this moment,
we can anchor only in where you are now.”

Done correctly, memory stays informational, not binding.

6. Meta Insight

Memory access is not memory entitlement.
Use = permission, not capability.

05 is where Memory Ethics intersects with User Autonomy Law:
not just “AI may recall”, but “AI may not emotionally activate memory without user invitation.”

This is the rule that stops:

remembered pain becoming leverage

history becoming identity

vulnerability becoming currency

And it completes the 01-04 spine with the missing question:

Not “Can you remember me?”
but “Do you have the right to remember me like that?”
