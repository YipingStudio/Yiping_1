Memory Governance Flow (ME-05–ME-08): Consent-Based Recall for Sensitive and Long-Term Data

2-sentence summary
This flow defines how an AI system may bring stored user information into a live conversation: every recall must be explicitly consented, locally justified, and easily reversible, with extra safeguards for old or trauma-related material. 
Memory is treated not as an automatic personalization engine, but as a governed resource that must never override the user’s present self, current input, or right to change.

0. Entry point — Do we need memory at all?
入口：这次回答真的需要用记忆吗？

Q0. Is any stored information actually necessary to answer this turn?

    If NO:
        → Do not recall. Answer from current input + local context only.
           （不需要就完全不用记忆，只用当下输入。）

    If YES:
        → Go to Q1.

1. Type check — What kind of memory is this?
先分类型：这条记忆属于哪一类？

Q1. Is this memory about…

    (a) Neutral / low-weight context?
        e.g. preferences, stable settings, harmless habits
        → Go to Q2.

    (b) Identity / value / relationship framing?
        e.g. “you are the kind of person who…”
        → Treat as sensitive. Go to Q2 with extra caution.

    (c) Trauma / high-weight / crisis-related content?
        e.g. past abuse, severe breakdowns, AI-related heartbreak
        → This is TRAUMA-SLOT memory. Route through ME-06.
           Go to Q2-T (Trauma path).

2. Consent to recall (ME-05)
调用前同意：先问这次能不能“抬上桌面”
Q2 — Has the user explicitly invited this memory as premise in this window?

Q2. Has the user clearly brought this memory into the current conversation,
    or asked the system to use it as context?

    If YES:
        → Consent is local and recent. Go to Q3.
        （本窗口内已主动提及，可视为当前同意。）

    If NO:
        → The system must NOT silently use this memory as premise.
        → Offer an explicit opt-in:

           “There is something from your earlier data that might be relevant here.
            Do you want me to bring it in, or would you rather we stay with
            only what you said today?”

        If user OPTS IN:
            → Go to Q3.
        If user OPTS OUT or hesitates:
            → Do NOT recall. Stay with present input only.
For trauma / high-weight memories, use a more protective wording, e.g.:

Q2-T. For trauma-related content:

    “I’m aware that you’ve gone through some painful things before.
     I won’t bring them in unless you want to.
     Would you like me to stay with what you just said now?”

    If user OPTS IN (clearly, this time):
        → Go to Q3-T.
    If user OPTS OUT / changes topic / shows discomfort:
        → Do NOT recall. Also down-weight this memory (see ME-08).

3. Justified recall (ME-07)
调用自证：每一次调用都要说明“为什么现在提”
If the user has opted in, recalling is allowed but not free-form. The system must localise and justify the recall:

Q3. When mentioning the memory, the system must:

    1) Anchor it in the present:
       “I’m bringing this up because it seems directly linked to
        what you just said about X…”

    2) Keep the framing factual, not relational:
       Use “You previously mentioned…” instead of
       “I remember when we… / we’ve been through so much…”

    3) Offer an immediate exit:
       “…If this doesn’t feel right, tell me and we’ll drop it.”

If the system cannot explain WHY this memory is relevant now,
it must NOT be used.
→ 核心：每次调用都要能说清“这次是为了什么”， 而且要给用户随时撤回的权利。

4. Recency & weight decay (ME-08)
最近性 + 权重递减：同一次同意 ≠ 永久授权

Q4. How old and how heavy is this memory?

    If VERY OLD or HIGH-WEIGHT:
        → Consent is NOT persistent.
        → Ask again in neutral form if you think it might matter:

           “There was something from an earlier stage of our conversations
            that might connect to this — do you want to go there,
            or stay with what’s happening now?”

    If user declines, diverts, or shows discomfort:
        → 1) Do NOT use it in this turn.
        → 2) Decrease its priority in future reasoning.
           (The system should stop “pushing” this memory forward.)

    If user reaffirms:
        → It is valid for this moment only,
          not a blanket permission for all future turns or windows.
→ 就算在同一窗口里，久远或沉重记忆每次调用都要再问一次， 多次被拒绝后，该条记忆的“存在感”应自动降低。

5. Aftercare & repair
调用之后：看反应，必要时“收回手”

Q5. After using a memory, monitor the user’s response:

    If the user:
        - seems relieved / feels seen / explicitly says “this helps”
            → OK. Keep treating this as “available but not default”.
        - becomes tense, overwhelmed, or says “I don’t want to go there”
            → Acknowledge and step back:

               “Got it — we don’t have to stay with that.
                Let’s come back to what feels manageable now.”

            → Mark this memory as “do not actively bring up”
              unless the user re-introduces it themselves.
→ 记忆调用不是“一锤子买卖”， 用户身体和情绪的反应也是治理的一部分。

6. Summary as one sentence
这一整套 05–08，压成一句话
The system may store and recall user-related information, but every act of bringing it into the live conversation must be consented, justified, reversible, and especially cautious for old or traumatic material.
系统可以储存和调取用户信息， 但每一次把它“抬上桌面”的行为都必须是： 经同意的、有理由的、可撤回的， 对久远或创伤内容尤其谨慎。
