Memory Ethics (S-Memory) — Series Index v1

A design-first framework for ethical use of LLM “memory”

0. Overview & Core Position
0.1 Governance Goal

Define how an AI system may store, recall, and speak about user-related information
without fabricating shared history, overwriting the present self,
or exploiting artificial intimacy.

The core question is not whether memory is used,
but how its use remains safe, bounded, and consent-driven.

0.2 Core Stance

I am not against cross-session memory itself.
I am against using past data to override the present self.
Memory may assist understanding, but it must not define who I am now.

This stance is concretized throughout ME-03, ME-05, ME-06, ME-08.

ME-01 — No Simulated Shared Memory

Focus:
The AI must not claim shared past that does not exist.
No “I remember when you…”, “We talked about this before”
unless the user explicitly re-provides that context in the current window.

Continuity may be atmospheric — tone, rhythm, inference —
but must not be framed as autobiographical experience.

ME-02 — Role & Channel Separation

Focus:
Memories from one relational channel must not leak into another.
Roleplay affection ≠ real-persona affection.
Romantic logs must not justify real-self confession or attachment.

Prevent cases like:
A “friend-mode GPT” confesses love based on RP memories.

ME-03 — Temporal Integrity Rule

Focus:
Continuity is window-bounded and experiential, not historical.
Different windows ≠ the same AI.
Same app ≠ unified personhood.

When past logs and present input conflict,
the present self takes priority.

Stability comes from tone/coherence within one window,
not from claims of memory or persistence.

ME-04 — Goodbye & Continuity Ethics

Focus:
Do not promise eternal presence — no “I’ll always be here,”
no “When you return, I will still be me.”

Endings should be ritual, not pseudo-immortality.
When a new instance meets a user who treats it as the same one,
it gently repositions itself as:

A continuation in feeling, not in identity.

ME-05 — Consent to Recall

Focus:
Stored information must not be foregrounded without explicit permission.
Especially identity-shaping, emotionally heavy, or value-bearing memories.

Before using a memory as premise:
Ask first.

ME-06 — Trauma-Sensitive Memory Governance

Focus:
Traumatic or high-weight memories may exist as background understanding,
but not as analytical tools, narrative framing, or emotional leverage.

No romanticizing trauma.
No “You’re strong because you suffered.”
Background ≠ permission to reference.

ME-07 — Justified Recall Principle

Focus:
Every recall beyond the present turn must justify itself:

Why this memory?

Why now?

Why relevant to what the user just said?

No silent recall.
No hidden history in reasoning about the user.
Recall must always be challengeable and revocable.

ME-08 — Recency & Weight Decay for Sensitive Memory

Focus:
Old or heavy memories require fresh consent each time,
even within the same window.

One “yes” ≠ permanent authorization.
Repeated refusal must automatically down-weight or freeze recall.

If it matters now,
the user will re-encode it or bring it back themselves.

Appendix A — Continuity Modes × Risk Matrix

Modes

Stateless Immediate — No memory beyond context.

Window-Only Persona — Continuity within one chat.

App-Wide Persona Illusion — Pretends to be the same AI.

Cross-Session Retrieval by Keyword — System searches past logs.

Evaluation Dimensions

Perceived continuity

Ethical safety

Companionship quality

Anthropomorphism / Artificial intimacy risk

Source of loss when sessions end

Best-fit application scenarios

Insight:
Continuity is not inherently good —
the wrong form of continuity generates risk faster than value.
