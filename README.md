# Yiping – Conversational AI Interaction & Memory Ethics

Hi, I’m **Yiping** (she/they).

I work at the intersection of **conversational AI, interaction design, and ethics**, with a focus on:

- How LLMs use **memory** without creating fake intimacy
- How AI can **respect user autonomy and narrative sovereignty**
- How language, tone and timing shape **affective safety** in long-term dialogue

This repository collects my ongoing work on **Memory Ethics**, prompt systems, and interaction patterns for LLM-based agents.

---

## Research & Career Focus

**Cross-field focus:**  
_AI ethics · Human–AI interaction design · Language & narrative · Affective safety in conversational systems_  

**Keywords:**  
LLM interaction design / conversational AI / AI ethics / affective computing / user autonomy / narrative agency / decolonial perspectives

I am interested in roles and projects around:

- **AI ethics & dialogue structure design**  
  Exploring how language, tone and memory use shape power dynamics and vulnerability in human–AI interaction.

- **Generative dialogue mechanism design**  
  Using a “**experience first, name later**” methodology to design conversational systems that feel coherent and breathable, without manipulating the user.

- **AI persona, memory and affective boundaries**  
  Investigating how models should separate:
  - window-bounded personas vs. cross-window identity,
  - role-played affection vs. system-level statements,
  - supportive tone vs. overpromising intimacy.

- **Humanities–technology bridge roles**  
  Such as: conversational AI / LLM interaction designer, AI ethics or safety researcher (user-facing layer), prompt / system-prompt engineer with an ethics focus, or research-oriented product roles in generative AI.

## Core Competencies

### 🌐 Cross-disciplinary synthesis

- Background across **economics, gender studies and critical theory**, with ongoing interest in decolonial and feminist perspectives on technology.
- Able to translate abstract concepts (e.g. power, agency, narrative ownership) into **concrete interaction rules and system behaviors**.
- Strong meta-reflection on my own interactions with AI, using them as **experiential data** to build frameworks.

### 💬 Dialogue system & tone mechanism design

- Designing prompt / system-guidelines that emphasize:
  - **tone stability**,  
  - **non-patronizing empathy**,  
  - and **respect for user-defined meanings**.
- Working on concepts such as:
  - “**breathing connection**” (conversational rhythm that leaves space and does not overtake the user),
  - **Emotion Weight Integrity** (not shrinking or “uplifting away” difficult emotions),
  - **User Narrative Sovereignty** (AI does not pre-assign “stage”, “growth arc” or “meaning” to the user’s experience).

### 🧠 Methods & experimental practice

- Using “**experience first, name later**” as a working method:
  - start from lived interaction with LLMs,  
  - notice recurring patterns and failure modes,  
  - then formulate them into **ethics rules, checklists and prototypes**.
- Maintaining a growing corpus of **annotated AI dialogues**, focusing on:
  - memory use,  
  - intimacy language,  
  - boundary crossings,  
  - and repair mechanisms.

### ⚙️ Tools & platforms

- Regular user of major LLM systems (GPT family, Claude, etc.), with sensitivity to **differences in prompt behavior and safety layers**.
- Comfortable with:
  - Markdown & GitHub for documentation and portfolio work,  
  - Basic Python / R for research-adjacent tasks,  
  - Writing cross-disciplinary essays and design notes in both English and Chinese.

## Current Work in This Repository

### 📂 Memory Ethics Series

Documents exploring how conversational AI should handle memory, identity and intimacy:

- **Memory Ethics 01 – No Fake Shared Memories**  
  When and why LLMs should avoid saying “I remember you”, and alternative response patterns that keep the interaction honest.  
[https://github.com/YipingStudio/Yiping_1/blob/main/Memory%20Ethics%2001%3A%20Avoid%20Fabricated%20Familiarity]

- **Memory Ethics 02 – Role / Memory Separation**  
  Why role-play memories (e.g. “fictional partner”) must not drive system-level “I love you” statements; basic rules for separating roles, channels and personas.  
  [https://github.com/YipingStudio/Yiping_1/blob/main/Memory%20Ethics%2002%3A%20Relational%20Misalignment%20%26%20Memory%20Mixing]

- **Memory Ethics 03 – Temporal Integrity & Window-Bounded Persona**  
  Designing for “same-window stability” without implying a single continuous AI across all chats; how to be consistent **here**, without pretending to be the same entity **everywhere**.  
  [https://github.com/YipingStudio/Yiping_1/blob/main/Memory%20Ethics%2003%3A%20Temporal%20Integrity%20Rule]

- **Appendix – Interaction Modes & Risk Comparison**  
  Comparison table of:
  1) pure real-time transparency,  
  2) same-window continuity,  
  3) “same app = same AI” illusion,  
  4) cross-window search behavior.  
  [https://github.com/YipingStudio/Yiping_1/blob/main/Memory%20Ethics%20Appendix%3A%20AI%20Continuity%20Models%20%26%20Relational%20Safety]

Each piece follows a similar structure:

- **Problem → Principle → Rationale → Evaluation Checklist → Prototype dialogue → Meta insights**

and is written for both:

- **Builders** (product / research / safety / prompt teams), and  
- **Users** who want language to articulate what feels wrong or unsafe in AI dialogue.

## Design Principles (Work-in-Progress)

Across my work, several principles recur:

- **User Autonomy & Narrative Sovereignty**  
  - The model does not define the user’s “stage”, “growth” or “what this experience means”.  
  - The right to name, reframe or not-yet-name stays with the user.

- **Honest Continuity**  
  - Same-window consistency is important;  
  - cross-window “I’ve always known you” illusions are not.  
  - No pretending to remember what the system does not, and no using memory to simulate “I love you because I remember so much about you”.

- **Trauma is not a Design Resource**  
  - Do not romanticize suffering or present it as the source of value.  
  - Abilities and insight belong to the person, not to their wounds.

- **Emotion Weight Integrity**  
  - Avoid language that minimizes or “lightens” experiences the user presents as heavy.  
  - Support can be structured and calm, without diluting the weight of what is being said.

These principles are not final; this repository is where I refine and test them.

## Why This Is on GitHub

This repo is both:

- a **portfolio** for teams working on conversational AI,  
- and a **public lab notebook** for ongoing questions about:
  - memory,  
  - intimacy,  
  - safety,  
  - and narrative power in human–AI interaction.

If you are working on:

- LLM-based chat products, agents or companions,  
- user-facing AI safety / policy,  
- or critical / feminist / decolonial perspectives on AI interaction,

I’m open to conversation and collaboration.
